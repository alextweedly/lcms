## Transport

Arduaine, Kilmelford and Kilninver can be reached by public transport, as described below.

We would also like to facilitate the sharing of transport for the local residents. We will provide space where anyone can offer to share a ride with others in the community (e.g. either regular trips to nearby towns, or one-off trips to more distant cities or events).
